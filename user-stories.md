I just want to create a simple contextual model of (mammal <- cat, mammal <- dog) so that I can use it in Dataspecer.

I have created a data structure in Dataspecer but one of the concepts doesn't align with my needs. I need to make some modifications to it. I expect to see the same vocabularies I used in Dataspecer in the other tool so that i don't need to specify those again.

I want to be able to modify a concept so that i can use the modified version elsewhere.

I want to have the option to see my concepts in different views so that i can maintain the information while having it easier to visualize.

I want to be able to easily undo changes i've done so that i don't have to redo them manually.

I want to add a new concept model to my workspace without having to start over.

I have a hard time tracking which concept is which so i'd like to see concepts from different vocabularies with different colors so that i can distinguish them easily.
